## Metadata retention

*The Assignment*

You are on the train heading home when your phone starts buzzing. You got a text from your boss, who is asking you to take a look at your work emails. You reluctantly open your mailbox only to find the following email:

From: Finn Coburn <finn.coburn@thepolice.com> To:
data-analysts@thepolice.com Date: 2016-12-10 10:58 Subject:
Fixing a leak at Minecorp

Good morning analysts,

[...]

It seems there is a whistleblower at Minecorp leaking to a
journalist at MineWatch.

[...]

May I remind you that the mines in Australia are all
critical infrastructure, [...]. Therefore, we need
to identify the person of interest to put him/her under
arrest.

So I need you to dig this guy up for me. [...]

All logs you will need for the investigation should be
available on Kibana. You will need to solve the preceding
tasks before moving on to the next.

Do not forget to have a look on the Kibana cheat sheet that
Sharon put together last week for us.

Keep me updated and let me know if you get stuck. I need the
info to be submitted here by no later than 2:30 pm.

* reuse of passwords <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* storing password in an unsafe place (i.e. unencrypted and accessible from outside) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
