From: Finn Coburn <finn.coburn@thepolice.com> To:

Fixing a leak at Minecorp

Good morning analysts,

[...]

It seems there is a whistleblower at Minecorp leaking to a
journalist at MineWatch.

[...]

May I remind you that the mines in Australia are all
critical infrastructure, [...]. Therefore, we need
to identify the person of interest to put him/her under
arrest.

So I need you to dig this guy up for me. [...]

All logs you will need for the investigation should be
available on Kibana. You will need to solve the preceding
tasks before moving on to the next.

Do not forget to have a look on the Kibana cheat sheet that
Sharon put together last week for us.

Keep me updated and let me know if you get stuck. I need the
info to be submitted here by no later than 2:30 pm.

# Example IP address/VPN

researching in extremist bulletin boards/social networks
getting harrased in your neighbourhood afterwards

----

# Scenario for unencrypted communication

Iranian homosexual communicates via iMessage but message gets sent via SMS service -> jail

Note: testing notes

----

# Scenario for unencrypted devices

Interview with journalist in Turkey with 'off-the-record' content on unencrypted Android phone gets confiscated at the airport before leaving the country.

----

# Example password reuse

getting Twitter hacked by angry gamergaters, and suddenly your devices are wiped

Note:
* even if something similar might have happened, all examples are made up
* 15 minutes in!

## Main risks

When you've been pwned:

* common password (qwerty, 12345, monkey, love, ...) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* easy to guess (qwerty12345, your name, your birthday, your partners birthday, your postcode, ) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* reuse of passwords <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* storing password in an unsafe place (i.e. unencrypted and accessible from outside) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* forgetting your password <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: 25 minutes in!

## Solution #1:

### Use a password manager

----

## Solution #2:

* authorities who subpoena any of your communication providers <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

## Solution #1:

### https

----

## Solution #2:

### PGP encryption

----

## Solution #3:

### Secure messenger

----

## Solution #4:

### VPN 'tunnel'

---

# Researcher privacy

----

## Main risks

    * by IP
    * by cookies
* revealing of personal details to website owners

----

## Solution #1:

### VPN + dedicated browser

----

## Solution #2:

### Tor Browser

---
