# Why are we here?

Note:
* Over the next 2 hours we are going to explore common security and privacy concerns for researchers & some solutions to them.
* To get started thinking about security & privacy let's run through a few examples.

----

## Metadata retention

*The Assignment*

You are on the train heading home when your phone starts buzzing. You got a text from your boss, who is asking you to take a look at your work emails. You reluctantly open your mailbox only to find the following email:

----

```txt
From: Finn Coburn <finn.coburn@thepolice.com> To:
data-analysts@thepolice.com Date: 2016-12-10 10:58 Subject:
Fixing a leak at Minecorp

Good morning analysts,

[...]

It seems there is a whistleblower at Minecorp leaking to a
journalist at MineWatch.

[...]

May I remind you that the mines in Australia are all
critical infrastructure, [...]. Therefore, we need
to identify the person of interest to put him/her under
arrest.

So I need you to dig this guy up for me. [...]

All logs you will need for the investigation should be
available on Kibana. You will need to solve the preceding
tasks before moving on to the next.

Do not forget to have a look on the Kibana cheat sheet that
Sharon put together last week for us.

Keep me updated and let me know if you get stuck. I need the
info to be submitted here by no later than 2:30 pm.

Note:
* One example of a privacy and security risk faced by everyone, not just researchers is the retention of metadata and the unexpected ways in which it can be used.
* Would any of you like to suggest a definition of metadata?
* Metadata is activity records - records of what you have done and when, but not the content of what you have done.

(http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/how-team-of-pre-teens-found-whisteblower-using-metadata/8113668)

Note:
* Snitchhunt is a game designed by Gabor Szathmari of CryptoParty Sydney to demonstrate how metadata that is kept on every one of us can be used to track our movements.
* The original website has been taken down but Rosie Williams (@info_aus) has made a new online version (link included in resources at the end of this presentation)

----

# worst case scenarios

----

## weak password reuse

your Twitter accounts is hacked by angry gamergaters, and suddenly your devices are wiped

----

### Activity

Visit https://haveibeenpwned.com/ and look up your most used email address.

Note:
* demo first on our own account.
* explain about use of coloured stickynotes - put up red one if you need help, green one if you have finished activity.
* now go ahead and check your email
* FIXME: What heading level should this have?

----

## revealing IP address/VPN

researching in extremist bulletin boards/social networks
getting harassed in your neighbourhood afterwards

----

## unencrypted communication

communication with protesters in an authoritarian surveillance state via iMessage but message gets sent via SMS service

----

## unencrypted devices

interview with journalist in country opressing the press with 'off-the-record' content on unencrypted Android phone gets confiscated at the airport before leaving the country.

Note:
* even if something similar might have happened, all examples are made up
* also: Felix's stolen hard drive
* 15 minutes in!

---

# Group activity!

----

# Why are you here?

What do you want to get out of this session?
What privacy or security issues might effect your research?
Discuss in groups (5 minutes)

Note:
* break into groups
* discuss what privacy or security issues might effect your research & summarise on butchers paper
* each group report back

---

# Passwords
one ring to rule you all

----

## Main risks

When you've been pwned:

* common password (qwerty, 12345, monkey, love, ...) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* easy to guess (qwerty12345, your name, your birthday, your partners birthday, your postcode, ) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* reuse of passwords <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* storing password in an unsafe place (i.e. unencrypted and accessible from outside) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* forgetting your password <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: 25 minutes in!

----

## Solution #1:

### Use a password manager

Note:
QUESTIONS:
* Who is using a password manager?
* Which one?

----

## What is a password manager?

* allows you to access all your passwords with a master password and/or keyfile ("secret file", e.g. on a USB stick) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* stores passwords in an encrypted file (i.e. not readable without a key) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* can often generate secure passwords for you <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Therefore your passwords will be strong, will not be reused, and you don't have to worry about memorising them anymore. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

## We recommend

* KeePass, KeePassX, KeeWeb
    * Open source +
    * interoperable +
    * high reputation +
    * free +
    * not so convenient -
* 1Password
    * high reputation +
    * very convenient +
    * costs money -
    * closed source -

Note:
* links to all these are provided on the resources page at end of presentation

----

## Solution #2:

### Use 2-factor-authentication

----

## What is 2-factor authentication?

* comparable to TAN system for online banking<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* requires a second form of authentication additionally to a password <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* this second element changes over time<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* most secure forms of this are bound to a device you carry with you, e.g. an app on your phone, or even more secure on a dedicated device<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* most major internet services have it, if not this might be a warning sign<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

## SMS is not a secure channel!

![Due to today's incident, it's possible some SMS messages were incorrectly delivered. All messages will be held while we resolve the issue.](TelstraSMSProblemsTweet.png)

Note:
* Last week Telstra outage caused by fire in Sydney exchange resulted in many SMS's being delivered to wrong phones

----

## SMS problems

* misdelivery
* unauthorised phone number porting
* not available during phone outages

Note:
* There has been examples in news lately of people repeatedly having their umbers ported just using their name and DOB as authorisation
* Same Telstra outage last week stopped people receiving SMS for 2FA

----

## We recommend

Use an app for 2 factor authentication

* [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/)
* [Google Authenticator (Android/iPhone/BlackBerry)](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en)
* [Amazon AWS MFA (Android)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061MU68M)
* [Authenticator (Windows Phone 7)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/authenticator/9wzdncrfj3rj)

----

# Group activity!

Find out whether one of your most used services provides 2-factor-authentication

Note:
* break into groups
* check if service supports 2fa & summarise on butchers paper
* each group report back

---

# Communication

----

## Main risks

While transmitting sensitive information: the men in the middle

* others in open/untrusted WiFi <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* your email/messaging provider or anybody who has hacked or pretends to be them <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* authorities who subpoena any of your communication providers <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

## Solution #1:

### PGP encryption

"Pretty Good Privacy"

----

## What is PGP encryption?

* puts a padlock on any data you want<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* makes it possible to sign data<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* padlock is a 'public key'<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* 'secret key' can open the padlock and sign data<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

## What is PGP encryption?

In most use cases you sign data with your secret key (put your verifiable signature on it), encrypt it with the public key of a recipient (put a padlock on it), and the recipient decrypts the data with his secret key (key for the padlock), while being able to verify your signature with your public key.

----

## We recommend

* [keybase](https://keybase.io/)
* [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org/)
* [Enigmail for Thunderbird](https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/)
* lots of mail clients have GPG support

----

# Group activity!

Get your keybase account with the invitation code we've sent you and encrypt a message to somebody else in this workshop. Send it to their email address.

Note:
* FIXME: I think we need to add screenshots & instructions for this? Or demo it - need a slide for the demo then I think.
* FIXME: Explain about verifying that the key belongs to who you think it does - need to do this more thoroughly for more critical communication

----

## Solution #2:

### Secure messenger / Private messaging

----

## What is a secure messenger?

* encrypts message end-to-end per default (i.e. messages are only readable by sender and recipient, not by the message service provider)
* explicitly does not store activity records (metadata)
* is open source
* optional: has self-destructing messages (i.e. messages are deleted on both ends after a pre-defined timespan)

----

## We recommend

[Signal](https://whispersystems.org/)

Note:
* make sure you confirm that you are speaking to who you expect to be at the other end, and that the encryption is working properly before you exchange any confidential information.

---

# Researcher privacy

----

## Main risks

when researching on the internet:

* activity record (metadata) retention (by state/institution/ad networks)
    * by IP address (like a 'phone number' for your computer)
    * by browser cookies (like customer cards in shops, just for your browser)
* revealing of personal details to website owners
* other forms of browser finger printing

Note:
* your IP address may reveal your location, and stays the same at least during a single session, and possibly all the time. This means it can be used to track your visits across multiple websites
* browser cookies are stored on your computer and used to customise your experience of a website, but can also be used to track your use of a website and even between websites.
* if you login to a website you have provide your account details to that website and to your IP address
* new ways of identifying website visits are always being explored, for example using which fonts your browser reports as a finger print to identify your browser.

----

## Solution #1:

### https

----

## What is https?

* browser checks whether website has a valid certificate ('ID card')
* encrypts traffic between browser and website

----

## We recommend

* check the address bar in your browser
* https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/64u41gygdnzk0k8/2017-02-05%20at%201.41%20pm.png)

Examples for bad certificates: https://badssl.com/

----

# Group activity!

visit https://browserleaks.com

----

## Solution #2:

### VPN 'tunnel'

----

## What is a VPN?

* prevents eavesdropping, e.g. in an open WiFi
* BUT: does not verify certificates ('ID cards')
* hides your IP address (i.e. location, internet provider, other visited websites) from servers you communicate with
* can make you appear to be in another country and circumvent DNS or geo-blocking

----

## We recommend

Choose a VPN service which:

* claims not to store activity records (hard to verify)
* uses OpenVPN
* has servers in safe jurisdictions
* not insert advertising into your browsing stream

Remember that if it's too cheap you might be paying in other ways.

[NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) and [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) both have a long term high reputation

----

## Solution #2:

### Tor Browser

----

## What is Tor Browser?

* provides secure, not easily identifiable browser that doesn't leave traces
* onion-network (encrypted tunnel through encrypted tunnel through encrypted tunnel ...)
* does not prevent you from disclosing your identity e.g. by logging into Facebook

----

## We recommend

Use for high risk research, not for everyday use.

----

# Group activity!

Install Tor Browser and visit https://browserleaks.com again.

Tor Browser: https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en

Note:
* Explain about using signatures to verify downloads?
* What did you find was different in browserleaks report?

---

# Data storage

----

## Main risks

when storing data:

* unauthorised access to data, e.g. in the cloud
* unwanted access to devices, e.g. at airports
* data loss
* lost access

----

## Solution

----

# backup, backup, backup

3 independent copies

![](http://blog.serverfault.com/files/2016/02/encrypt-all-the-things1.png)

**... but don't forget your keys.**
*(hint: use a password manager)*

----

## We recommend

* full device/disk/USB stick â¦ encryption (mostly provided by OS)
* for files in the cloud:
    * [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/)
    * [keybase](https://keybase.io/)
    * disk image encryption by your operating system

MAKE SURE YOU NEVER LOOSE YOUR KEYS OR PASSPHRASES!!! Or all will be lost.

Note:
* Most encryption services offer multiple ways of storing your keys or passphrases - take advantage of them, but make sure you store the keys or passphrases securely.

----

# Group activity!

Encrypt a file with keybase for you/for somebody else.

---

# How to choose a tool?

----

1. Open Source?
2. independent security audit/reputation?
3. will you actually use it?

---

# Where to from here?

At end of the presentation there is a list of all the software we've mentioned today and a list of useful websites for more information.

Depending on the level of risk to you or your research participants you may need to seek advice from a security/privacy expert before you begin your research.

Note:
* Risks/Solutions are changing over time, so important to get current advice before you start your research.
